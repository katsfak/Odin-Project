# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based drawing grid built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hover over the squares to draw, change the grid size, or clear the board.

## Features

- 16x16 default grid rendered with Flexbox
- Hover to draw with random colors that darken to black after 10 passes
- Change grid size (1-100) while keeping the same total canvas size
- Clear button to reset the grid

## Demo

Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.

## How It Works

- The grid is generated dynamically in JavaScript.
- Flexbox wraps square divs to form a grid inside a fixed-size container.
- Hovering over a cell applies a random color and progressively darkens it.
