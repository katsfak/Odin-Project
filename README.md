# Odin Project Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and practice projects from The Odin Project curriculum. Each folder is a standalone mini project with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects

- [Etch-a-Sketch](Etch-a-Sketch/README.md)
- [Landing Page](Landing-Page/README.md)
- [Odin Recipes](Odin-Recipes/README.md)

## How To Run
